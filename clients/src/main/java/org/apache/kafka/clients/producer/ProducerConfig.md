* TODO:

  * == MAXIMUM batch's size
    * == NO attempts to batch records / size > this value
  * allows
    * 👀if MULTIPLE records want to be sent to the SAME partition -> producer batch records TOGETHER | fewer requests 👀
      * -> BETTER performance | client & server
  * units of bytes
  * requests / sent to brokers -> will contain MULTIPLE batches (1 batch / EACH partition / data ready to be sent)
  * as smaller -> 
    * batching LESS common
    * MAY reduce throughput
    * if =0 == disable batch size
  * if it's VERY large -> MAY use memory wastefully
    * Reason: 🧠Kafka allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation 🧠
  * `linger.ms`
    * := time (in milliseconds) / wait up, BEFORE sending a request
      * goal
        * MORE records will arrive / fill up the SAME batch
    * 👀if currently | partition < `batch.size` -> wait during `linger.ms` 👀
    * by default, `=0`
      * 👀== IMMEDIATELY send out a record (ALTHOUGH < `batch.size`) 👀
    * recommendations
      * set `>0`
* `buffer.memory`
  * == TOTAL bytes of memory / used by the producer to buffer records / waiting to be sent to the server 
    * 👀if records are sent -- faster than -- they can be delivered to the server -> producer will block for `max.block.ms` 👀
      * ⚠️AFTERWARD, it will throw an exception ⚠️
  * 👀== (roughly) TOTAL memory used by the producer 👀
    * != HARD bound
      * Reason: 🧠memory used by the producer == memory for buffering + memory for compression (requires enable compression) + memory for maintaining in-flight requests 🧠
* TODO:

  * 👀if timeout exceeded `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG` ALTHOUGH # of retries NOT exhausted -> NO more attempts to retry == produce requests will be failed 👀
    * common use cases
      * unset `retries` & configure `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG`
